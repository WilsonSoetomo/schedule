# schedule

followed the template to color out the schedule based on chads recording on the zoom session

logic for storing values was found based on google searches that make up similar concepts such as noting down movie names and years of release. tried to figure out how to store the different datas of each row. considered turning each of the rows into independant keys each having their own ID.

still trying to configure the code. there seems to be an issue in regards to identifying eventlisterners on my javascript on line 40 addeventlistener could not be run on the browser.

I shall continue to tinker and find out what is wrong......
